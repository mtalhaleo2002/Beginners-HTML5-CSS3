An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.

HTML has many Input types.Here we discuss only main Input types.

The HTML <form> element/tag is used to create an HTML form for user input.
Form tag has many attribute like target, method but this is for backend develeopment .When you study , then you know this attribute how it works.
The <form> element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.

The HTML <input> element is the most used form element.
An <input> element can be displayed in many ways, depending on the type attribute.
Input tag can,t be closed.So it means that it have attributes
 
<input type="text">	Displays a single-line text input field.
<input type="radio">	Displays a radio button (for selecting one of many choices).
<input type="checkbox">	Displays a checkbox (for selecting zero or more of many choices).
<input type="submit">	Displays a submit button (for submitting the form).
<input type="button">	Displays a clickable button.

The <input type="text"> defines a single-line input field for text input.

The <label> tag defines a label for many form elements.
The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focuses on the input element.
The <label> element also helps users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox.
The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together.(For backend perspective)

The <input type="radio"> defines a radio button.
Radio buttons let a user select ONE of a limited number of choices.

The <input type="checkbox"> defines a checkbox.
Checkboxes let a user select ZERO or MORE options of a limited number of choices.

The <input type="submit"> defines a button for submitting the form data to a form-handler.
The form-handler is typically a file on the server with a script for processing input data.
The form-handler is specified in the form's action attribute.(For backend perspective)
