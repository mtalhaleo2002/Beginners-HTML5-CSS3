A table in HTML consists of table cells inside rows and columns.


A table cell can contain all sorts of HTML elements: text, images, lists, links, other tables, etc.

TABLE DATA
Each table cell is defined by a <td> and a </td> tag.
td stands for table data.
Everything between <td> and </td> are the content of the table cell.

TABLE ROW
Each table row starts with a <tr> and ends with a </tr> tag.
tr stands for table row.

TABLE HEADER
Sometimes you want your cells to be table header cells. In those cases use the <th> tag instead of the <td> tag.
th stands for table header.
By default, the text in <th> elements are bold and centered, but you can change that with CSS.
