The HTML <audio> element is used to play an audio file on a web page.
To play an audio file in HTML, use the <audio> element/tag.

The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.

To start an audio file automatically, use the autoplay attribute.

Add muted after autoplay to let your audio file start playing automatically (but muted).
