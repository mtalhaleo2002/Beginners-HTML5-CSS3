In this we study an important tag called Anchor Tag.

The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
Different Tags have diferent attributes.
Attribute can be written inside the anchor tag <a href= "" > </a> ( href means hyper-reference ).
If we want to add a ink in the text you can write link in thea trribute of href of inverted commas ( href = "www.google.com")
And we write in achor tag Google ( you can write anything you want )


And one more attribute to let you know inside the a tag <a rel=""></a>.
If you know about SEO you know that attribute and its value ( rel = "nofollow" , rel = "dofollow" ).
You don,t need to use this attribute.Leave this later we can study on it.

And one more attribute target = "" inside the a tag <a target = ""></a>,
Target attribute  specifies where to open the linked document:
If its value is this then :
_blank	Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
_self	Opens the linked document in the same frame as it was clicked (this is default).

And if we want to add new page then you can follow you will understand this (how to create page , and how to link new.html in href tag )

And you see that if we want to create html in another folder ,we can give them path to relate the pages( you see the code , then you understands ).

And that text which have a link is called Hyper Text.
