The HTML <video> element is used to show a video on a web page.

The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.We would later discuss styling on CSS

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element.

To start a video automatically, use the autoplay attribute.

Add muted after autoplay to let your video start playing automatically (but muted).
