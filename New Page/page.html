  <b>Summary:</b>
  <p class="paragraph">welcome to HTML & CSS course <a href="www.google.com">Link</a> lorem ipsum is simply dummy text
    of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
    1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
    not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting.</p>
