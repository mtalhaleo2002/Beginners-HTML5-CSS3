In this we,ll see the scenarios of display.

You see the p span and u tag in which p tag get block level display and its border width almost can get the width of browser.
And other hand u and span tag is inline display element and whatever text is ther ein thes tags ,these tags can space occupy among their content. 

You inspect the element p in which you see the display block in styles in Inspect portion.
And other hand inline element canbe written and can be placed in InLine whenever the line goes empty and then shift to next line .

But block level element can occupy the width of whole line .If we add new p tag under the p tag you see the difference( You can see on code. )

You can see the code and output you better understands what display can actually do ?

You can browse which tags under the the block and inline elements.

If  I want to display none ,you can,t see the p tag and its content on the page.
