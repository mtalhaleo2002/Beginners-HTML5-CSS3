Image tag can,t be closed.It has attributes.

The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.

The <img> tag has two required attributes:
src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed

Also, always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the page might flicker while the image loads.
