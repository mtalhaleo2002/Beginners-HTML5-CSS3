But in color syling you can give color in the form of color name like red,blue,violet etc.

And other one you can pick the color from color picker ( You can find Color Picker on Internet ).Examples like #32a852, #35114d etc.

And another one is you can give the amount of rgb in which we can define the color in percentage of red, green, blue like rgb(55, 89, 10) etc.

And another one is rgba in which a means alpha (means transparency) and it can be like (55,76,11, 0.8) etc.Transparency,the alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).
